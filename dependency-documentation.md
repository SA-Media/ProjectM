## Dependency Management

The project uses npm workspaces to manage dependencies across the monorepo. This setup allows:

1. **Centralized dependency management**: Common dependencies can be installed at the root level
2. **Workspace-specific dependencies**: Each workspace can maintain its own dependencies
3. **Single node_modules folder**: Reduces duplication and disk space requirements
4. **Simplified scripts**: Run commands across all workspaces or target specific ones

## Version Compatibility Notes

- **Node.js**: The application requires Node.js â‰¥ 18.0.0 as specified in the backend's package.json engines field
- **React**: Using React 18 which introduced concurrency features and automatic batching
- **Vite**: Using Vite 4 which offers superior developer experience and build performance
- **Selenium**: Using Selenium 4 which has significant architectural changes from version 3

## Updating Dependencies

When updating dependencies, consider the following:

1. **Backend dependencies**: Update by running `npm update --workspace=backend`
2. **Frontend dependencies**: Update by running `npm update --workspace=frontend`
3. **Root dependencies**: Update by running `npm update`

Always verify compatibility and test thoroughly after updating dependencies, especially for major version upgrades.

## Security Considerations

Several dependencies handle sensitive operations:

- **jsonwebtoken**: Responsible for authentication token generation and verification
- **axios**: Handles HTTP requests that may contain sensitive data
- **mysql2**: Manages database connections and queries

Regularly update these packages to address security vulnerabilities, and ensure proper configuration to prevent common security issues.

## Environment-Specific Dependencies

The application uses environment variables (loaded via `dotenv`) to configure various behaviors. Key environment variables include:

- **Database connection parameters**: Used by mysql2
- **API keys**: Used by OpenAI and other external services
- **Port configurations**: Used by Express server

Ensure these are properly set in the environment or in a `.env` file (not committed to version control) for the dependencies to function correctly.
